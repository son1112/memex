   Listen: I am here because I experience impostor syndrome.
   I know that because
   * I have struggled with ::
   * I am working on ::
   * As a result ::
     * Proactively reframe myself at forks in the road


* Only you can

** Know
*** Who you are
**** Who you thrive amongst
*** What you are capable of
**** What others should expect of you

*** When you are ready to take an action
**** When your work is done
*** Where you are at your best
**** Where you are at your best
*** Why you are where you are
**** Why you want to be where you are
* Your trustworthiness

* Memories :noexport:
